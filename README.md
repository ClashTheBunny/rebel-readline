# rebel-readline

A terminal readline library for Clojure Dialects

WORK IN PRooooooGRESS!!

# Important note!!! 

The rebel line reader will attempt to manipulate the terminal
that initiated the JVM process. For this reason it is important
to start your JVM in a terminal.

That means launching your java process using the

 * the java command
 * the Clojure clj tool
 * lein trampoline 
 * boot - would need to run in boot's worker pod

Launching from a process initiated by lein will not work and
launching from a boot pod will not cut it either.

# Quick start

`lein trampoline run` will get you into a clojure repl with the readline working.

# Quick Lay of the land

You should look at `rebel-readline.main` and `rebel-readline.core`
to give you top level usage information.

The meat of the functionality is in `rebel-readline.line-reader` and
`rebel-readline.widgets.base` everything else is just support.

# CLJS

The rebel readline cljs library can be found in the 
`rebel-readline-cljs` directory.
